# prabodha research journal (append-only)

## 2026-07-07 — L0 foundation
- Scoping doc adopted as conceptual source of truth (copied to docs/).
- Interview decisions: E1 (Qwen replication) is L1; GB10 only (5090 not set up; prabhasa+PSALM
  co-resident, bandwidth-bound); ralph closure = code AND domain; GitHub via connector (tools not
  yet exposed — publish deferred).
- TRIZ C1–C3 resolved (docs/triz_log.md). Sibling harvest (docs/prior_art_internal.md): porting
  prabhasa EFE selector/ledger/autopilot + gpu_guard; ACD metrics patterns; neo-fm five-point gate.
- Infrastructure honest negative: SMB projects mount cannot host live git (unlink/lock semantics) —
  canonical repo lives in dev VM + GitHub; mount gets rsync mirror + git bundle. Sublated the
  "repo lives on the drive" assumption with evidence (failed lock/rm operations logged in session).
